# Spot Welder
This is an Arduino timer for my DIY spotwelder. 
It does one pulse, then waiting and then another pulse.
There are tree potentiometers for defining the timers. 
The first one is for the length of the first pulse. 
The second one is for the length of the waiting time. 
The third one is for the length of the Second pulse.
